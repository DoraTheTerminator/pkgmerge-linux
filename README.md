Merge PS4 pkg files in Linux


You can merge the pkg files by copying the merge.sh and pkg-merge-x64.exe to the folder containing the pkg files.

Then once you are there open the terminal then type this command:

chmod +x merge.sh

After that open the terminal in the folder containing the pkg files and the merge.sh and pkg-merge-x64.exe and type the following command:

./merge.sh

When the merging will be complete, the terminal will say "Package Merger has completed the task. You can now close the terminal."


You will see a file named "merged.pkg". This is your final merged file.
